    <p><b> Real life example:</b> Someone is trying to create a new account on a Reddit (just for an example). They have to come up with a unique username in order to create an account. They start typing in characters, and each time they do this, Reddit will let the user know if those set of characters are already taken up (invalid) or free to use (valid). How does Reddit know whether the username is taken or not? They have a sorted list (like the binary tree) that allows them to search quickly through the millions if not billions of usernames already taken. Searching an extremely large list in this way would be much faster than starting at the beginning of the list and checking every single username to see if it is already taken.</p>
