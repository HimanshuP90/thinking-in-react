 Agile methods primarily focus upon breaking up the entire product into smaller, easily developable, “shippable” product features developed through “incremental” cycles known as “sprints”.

 The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:[21]
1) 	Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2) 	Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
3) 	Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
4) 	Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5) 	Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6) 	Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7) 	Working software is the primary measure of progress
8) 	Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9) 	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10) Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11) Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12) Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

Scrum Meeting: 
The scrum meeting, in an agile development world, has every team member answer-------

i) What did you accomplish since the last meeting?
ii) What are you working on until the next meeting?
iii) What is getting in your way or keeping you from doing your job?
